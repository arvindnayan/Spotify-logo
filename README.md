# Spotify-logo
Here I am just try to creat a Spotify logo using python turtle.
My Steps are:
Importing turtle Library to use all its functions and draw the Logo.
For the Background color, we use the bgcolor() function to set the background color, And the speed() function is used to set the pen drawing speed.
Here we draw a Circle and use functions like begin_fill(), fillcolor(), and end_fill to fill the circle.
To Draw a first-line we goto the location(40,50), And use circle(), left() and forward() function to draw a curve line. Here we set the pen color to ‘black’ and pen size to 15.
Similarly for Second-line create a bigger curve line compare to the first line to the location(50,85).
Here is the third and last line of the Spotify logo, to do that we draw a curve line size of (120,60) at the location(60,120).
